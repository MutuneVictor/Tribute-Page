    <h2>In Loving Memory of Chadwick Boseman</h2> 

<p>In the small town of Anderson, South Carolina, on November 29, 1976, a luminous soul named Chadwick Aaron Boseman entered the world. From the very beginning, his childhood was woven with threads of imagination and a passion for storytelling that would go on to illuminate the silver screen.Chadwick was the youngest of three children. His father worked for an agricultural conglomerate and did upholstery work on the side, and his mother was a nurse.  </p>

While a student there, he took acting classes in a summer program of the British American Drama Academy at the University of Oxford and visited Ghana. Here, his talents flourished, and his commitment to authentic storytelling began to take root.</p>
